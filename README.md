# keylogger
A simple keylogger which captures keystrokes and sends the result to the discord server in every 15 seconds.
I created this for my University coursework.

## Installation
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/syscrafts/keylogger.git
  cd keylogger
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  python3 keylogger.py
```
